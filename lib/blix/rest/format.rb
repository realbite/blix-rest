# the format of a request is determined by
# - the uri extension    eg: .html
# - the mime type of the request ( only for html, xml, json )
# - in some cases a query parameter.

# this file is for looking into the idea of mapping
# multiple extensions and multiple mime types onto one
# format type.

# for now it does not seem neccessary.
